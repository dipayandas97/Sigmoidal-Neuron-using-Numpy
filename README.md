# Sigmoidal_Neuron_from_Scratch_using_Numpy
The basic building block of a Dense Neural Network.
\n ~ This is basic implementation of a single sigmoidal neuron with multiple inputs and single output, implemented from scratch using only Numpy as the only dependency.
\n ~ It uses Gradient Descent as its weight optimiser.
\n ~ The dataset is randomly created just to test the model.
\n ~ The number of inputs and weights can be adjusted by adding them into the elements and initializations in the respective arrays.
