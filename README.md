# Sigmoidal_Neuron_from_Scratch_using_Numpy
The basic building block of a Dense Neural Network.
This is basic implementation of a single sigmoidal neuron with multiple inputs and single output, implemented from scratch using only Numpy as the only dependency.
It uses Gradient Descent as its weight optimiser.
The dataset is randomly created just to test the model.
The number of inputs and weights can be adjusted by adding them into the elements and initializations in the respective arrays.
